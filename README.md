This is my major project .
Project Name: Stock Prediction System

Description:
This project builds an AI-powered stock prediction system that integrates multiple technical indicators—100-day & 200-day moving averages, 
RSI, and Bollinger Bands—along with a Random Forest model to make informed stock price predictions. The system analyzes historical stock data,
computes technical indicators, and combines them with machine learning to enhance decision-making. The goal is to provide more accurate 
and reliable stock trend forecasts.
